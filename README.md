# Gender Classification with Neural Network and MLflow

This project demonstrates how to build a deep learning model using TensorFlow for gender classification and integrate it with MLflow for experiment tracking. The model is trained on a pre-processed dataset, and the experiments are logged to a local MLflow server.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical data using `LabelEncoder` and scales features using `StandardScaler`.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: A multi-layer dense neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Logs parameters, metrics, and model artifacts to MLflow.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow
- MLflow
- pandas
- scikit-learn
